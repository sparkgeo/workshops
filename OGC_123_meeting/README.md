# README

The Jupyter notebook (.*ipynb) in this repo is intended to be ran using Google Colab following the instructions [here](https://sparkgeo.com/blog/stac-it-up-a-stac-tutorial/).

If you are running the notebook locally, we suggest working in a virtual environment as the notebook installs python packages using `!pip install`.
